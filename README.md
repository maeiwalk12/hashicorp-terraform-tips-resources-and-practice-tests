# ✅ HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate – Study Guide & Exam Tips

Just passed the **Terraform Associate** exam, and I wanted to share my prep experience for anyone looking to get certified. This exam goes beyond just writing Terraform code — it tests your ability to **understand infrastructure as code (IaC) concepts**, manage **Terraform lifecycle**, use **Terraform Cloud**, and troubleshoot real-world scenarios.

I prepped for around **2.5 to 3 weeks**, broken into:

- 📘 **1 week** studying Terraform fundamentals using the [official HashiCorp Learn portal](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/learn)  
- 🧠 **1 week** doing hands-on labs and building infra in AWS/Azure using Terraform  
- 🧪 **Final week** with **[Skillcertpro](https://skillcertpro.com/product/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-exam-questions/)** and  analyzing mistakes, and reviewing the [Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs)

## 🧭 Preparation Tips

✅ **Learn by doing** — Don't just read docs; build real infrastructure (S3 buckets, VMs, security groups, etc.)  
✅ Use **Terraform CLI** often — commands like `init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`, `taint`, `import`, `refresh`, and `state` show up often  
✅ Go through **official docs** and **HashiCorp Learn tutorials** — they align closely with exam questions  
✅ **Skillcertpro practice exams** helped a lot — the questions were realistic and scenario-based. I’d say **75–80%** were similar in structure and topic  
✅ Create a **cheat sheet** or flashcards of commands, file structure (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `terraform.tfvars`), and backend configuration

## 📌 High-Priority Topics

### 📂 Core Terraform Concepts
- IaC fundamentals  
- Terraform workflow: `init`, `plan`, `apply`  
- Execution plan and state file behavior  
- Resource vs Data blocks  

### 📦 Terraform State
- Purpose of the state file  
- Remote backends (S3, Terraform Cloud, etc.)  
- State locking, state file security, `terraform state` commands  

### 🔁 Variables & Outputs
- Input variables (`var.<name>`) and types  
- Output values  
- `locals`, `count`, `for_each`, `depends_on`, `dynamic` blocks  

### ⚙️ Modules
- Creating and using modules  
- `source`, `version`, and input/output handling  
- Public vs private module registry  

### 🧪 Terraform CLI
- `terraform fmt`, `validate`, `taint`, `import`, `output`  
- `terraform workspace`, `terraform state` subcommands  

### ☁️ Terraform Cloud & Enterprise
- Workspaces, VCS-driven workflows  
- Remote operations, CLI-driven runs  
- Sentinel, cost estimation basics  

### 🔐 Authentication & Provisioning
- Provider configurations and authentication (e.g., AWS creds)  
- Provisioners (file/remote-exec)  
- Resource lifecycle meta-arguments: `create_before_destroy`, `prevent_destroy`

## 🧪 Exam-Day Strategy

✅ **Target 85%+ in mock tests**  
✅ Revise `terraform.tfstate`, `backend`, `workspaces`, and modules before the test  
✅ Stay calm — questions are not lengthy, but **require precise understanding**  
✅ Use the **scratchpad** to eliminate incorrect answers  
✅ Don’t overthink — **the most straightforward and documented method** is usually the correct one  
✅ Focus on **real-world usage** — not just syntax

### ✅ Final Tip

> *Don’t just memorize — understand why Terraform behaves the way it does. Build, break, and debug infrastructure locally and in the cloud. That’s the best prep you can do.*
